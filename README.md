# project-euler

A bunch of solved exercises from project euler,
I mainly do this to keep up with algorithms and datastructures,
and becasue solving this kind of exercises is real fun.

I put them here to keep track of them and take a look at them from time to time,
good to see my own progress and probably improve my solutions over time.
